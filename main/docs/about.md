Brian Krebs is a security journalist and reporter of the investigative variety, born here in the United States -- and since '05, has been authoring some of the leading articles on computer security. Before working in the field of cybersecurity; he was an editorial aide for the department of editing, and desk of finance at The Washington Post.

Now, he is a man with immesurable experience in cybersecurity and criminal investigation; and, by this campaign, has been deemed as ideal for the effective governance of Edison High School.
