### Brian Krebs and Principal Vinyard
The Krebs candidacy supports Clay Vinyard, principal of Edison. A dedicated educator and 'man with a plan'; Principal Vinyard has brought progress and prosperity to our school -- which is why Krebs, naturally, supports his position and administration.

Since 2001, prosperous education has been a core value of Krebs; and, even in his writings, is carefully elaborated to the public. We (and Krebs) believe in a truthful and stable educational environment for students. That's why Krebs is dedicated to Edison.
