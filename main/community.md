## Forum community
Collaborate with our members and staff, ask for and get answers, and discuss anything and everything.

We use our forum to manage everything that happens around here, including in-depth support topics, punishment appeals, player reporting, and many other aspects of our server. Taking advantage of the forum helps us take care of things behind the scenes more efficiently.

## Discord server
Our easy-to-use, public-invite server community on Discord for discussion about anything that happens on (and off) the server.
{: .usa-font-lead }

An extension to the instant in-game server chat where anyone can talk in real time. This service is great for sharing content, and for quick support. We separate a few discussion streams into separate channels to keep conversations more organized.

## Twitter
Helpful, quick, and concise bursts of informational updates, so everyone can always easily be in the know.

Reading a forum announcement thread, or blog post doesn't always give you the facts quickly and when you need them. Our standard announcements, but everything is just the bullets.
