## Guidelines
Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules. If you are caught breaking the guidelines, a staff member can take the necessary course of action.

### General policy
This portion of our rules focuses on standards we set for in-game conduct and gameplay etiquette. All of our guidelines reflect the optimal behavior practiced by example members.

 * **Don't harm the server.** Refrain from deliberately [lagging](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/lag-types-and-how-to-fix-them/) or [crashing](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Crash) the server. While we have plugins to prevent downtime, [massive edits](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit/Region_operations) should only be performed with the permission of a staff member. Exploiting said plugins is forbidden.

   Lag machines will be removed; don't [corrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption) the game and be distanced from exploitation. [Flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_flood) the chat with messages using text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed; [spambots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot) will be banned. [Advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising) isn't allowed in the main chat.

 * **Don't harm others.** Respect the wishes of other people and their privacy without circumstance. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to stay away from them and to remain respectful. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed.

   Staff members are capable of [rolling back](../docs/management) any grief using a block logging tool. Avoid derogatory remarks or comments that are potentially sexist, racist, or intended to offend. Don't use features with the sole purpose of annoying other members.

 * **Don't be malicious.** [Hacked clients](http://wiki.vg/Client_List) are allowed, but they can't be harmful. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to [malicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware), pornographic, or [hateful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) content in chat; and don't solicit illegality.

   Committing [rogue](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/were-going-rogue) activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their preferences without consent from that member. Attempting to [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameup) people is forbidden. No [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism).

 * **Comply with staff.** You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network (VPN) isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine or overwrite actions of members of staff.

   Offensive tags or nicknames will be removed. Threatening harm to yourself or other members will result in an immediate suspension. If a staff member doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned here; use common sense.

 * **Be respectful.** If someone is irritated, you're permitted to block other members; but don't block members of staff. Inappropriate or offensive content will be deleted and may result in a ban. Being an annoyance on any of our platforms is unacceptable and will result in a punishment.

<!--
### Specific policy
We also prefer to maintain the freedom of speech on our forum, but regulation is necessary.
These guidelines also apply to the guild and other resources.

 * **Control your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. Don't let others have access to your account; change your password regularly and practice high [security](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/). If an alternate account acts up, your main account will also be sanctioned.

   Members should notify an Executive or higher before making another account if they intend to do so. Anything that violates the United States law may be relayed to the appropriate authorities; we are based in the U.S. and work within its laws.

If you see anything with our name that's violating the posted guidelines or practices, it isn't us.
You can find out more about this matter [here](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/#watching-your-back). -->

#### Referral commands
 * `/motd` - Views the message of the day, with links to this page and more.
 * `/rules` - Directly refers members with a link to this page.
 * `/vote` - Refers members to server voting information.

## Reporting
Other members that have visibly broken the guidelines can be reported. Only file a report when a staff member isn't around to deal with the issue. There are different ways to report a member; one may be quicker for you than the other.

### In-game reports
Reporting a member in-game is very simple and requires no additional information than the name of who you're reporting; but you should still be careful with the tool and know what you're doing before filing a report.

 * `/report` - Reports a specified user and relays the message to staff members.

#### Command usage

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info" >
  <div class="usa-alert-body">
    <p class="usa-alert-text">Staff members can't be reported in-game; you must know the username of who you're reporting. <!--All filed reports are archived. -->If this won't do, file an online report instead.</p>
  </div>
</div>

 * `/report <user> <reason>` - Files a report. Specifying a username and reason are required.

### Online reports
Online reports will ask the name of whoever's in question, what they did, and why you think they did it. Reporting helps staff members improve their activity and effectively handle the situation.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info" >
  <div class="usa-alert-body">
    <p class="usa-alert-text">If you're reporting a staff member, please designate so in the report. If a situation is urgent and a staff member needs to be removed, please [contact](../contact) leadership.</p>
  </div>
</div>

You can file a report through the form [here](../report). It'll be read and we'll assign someone to deal with the problem; if nothing happens, [let us know](../contact).

## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed. We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal; you can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

 * You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
 * An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
 * You have been framed by another member, or unreasonably banned.

 <div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info" >
   <div class="usa-alert-body">
     <p class="usa-alert-text">Members filing appeals who are suspended must designate so in an appeal.</p>
   </div>
 </div>

No matter the platform you were barred from, all eligible members—as dictated by the requirements above—are entitled to file an appeal.

### Online appeals
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row. If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension. Use the form [here](../appeal).

If you've filed a ban appeal and you haven't been met with a response (reasonably), please [contact us](../contact) and we'll look through the records. If your ban was denied, please don't file duplicate entries.
