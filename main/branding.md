## A logo that's familiar
Always have a familiar face, and a consistent set of branding guidelines wherever our logo may appear. We work hard to keep the feel of the server consistent throughout our services, including having a consistent set of branding guidelines.

### Pictorial "N"
We use the pictorial logo everywhere. Anywhere the logo may be displayed, we have a color variant for it. When using in branding, don't distort the logo or re-color it.
