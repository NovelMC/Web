## Guided by principle
Everything that we're built around, every idea we adopt as a principle of the server, and down to who we select to be our staff members is cemented within our mission statement. Who we are as a server is where our values and trust lie as an organization; a supportive and experienced group of aspiring designers; developers, and engineers.

### Who we are
A group of aspiring designers; developers, and engineers. A collective who believes that sometimes everyone needs a place to kick back, block by block, bit by bit. An organization who is dedicated to transparency and excellence.

### What we're doing
Building an in-game community that's more resourceful, efficient, supportive, and always has the member at heart. We're putting architects, developers, and designers together for everyone's creative side.
