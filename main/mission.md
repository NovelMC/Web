## Guided by principle
Everything that we're built around, every idea we adopt as a principle of the server, and down to who we select to be our staff members is cemented within our mission statement. Who we are as a server is where our values and trust lie as an organization; a supportive and experienced group of aspiring designers; developers, and engineers.
